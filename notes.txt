Let each annotation draw itself. 

Let each annotation has its own select method for authoring time and select method for runtime. 


The SceneView widget has an active annotation tool.

==================================================

A scene consists of SceneNodes. 

The scene's root node is at the (0,0) position.

Each scene node corresponds to an object or an annotation.

Each scene node can have children scene nodes.

All children of a scene node have their positions relative to its position. 

We deliver the OpenCV frame with drawings for all scene nodes

Each scene node has a paint method.

When that paint method is called it draws itself on the given OpenCV frame, and calls recursively the paint method on all its children.
